  type: Class
  summary: Provides a base class for specifying dynamic behavior at run time. This class must be inherited from; you cannot instantiate it directly.
  remarks: "The `DynamicObject` class enables you to define which operations can be performed on dynamic objects and how to perform those operations. For example, you can define what happens when you try to get or set an object property, call a method, or perform standard mathematical operations such as addition and multiplication.  \n  \n This class can be useful if you want to create a more convenient protocol for a library. For example, if users of your library have to use syntax like `Scriptobj.SetProperty(\"Count\", 1)`, you can provide the ability to use much simpler syntax, like `scriptobj.Count = 1`.  \n  \n You cannot directly create an instance of the `DynamicObject` class. To implement the dynamic behavior, you may want to inherit from the `DynamicObject` class and override necessary methods. For example, if you need only operations for setting and getting properties, you can override just the <xref:System.Dynamic.DynamicObject.TrySetMember%2A> and <xref:System.Dynamic.DynamicObject.TryGetMember%2A> methods.  \n  \n In C#, to enable dynamic behavior for instances of classes derived from the `DynamicObject` class, you must use the `dynamic` keyword. For more information, see [Using Type dynamic](../Topic/Using%20Type%20dynamic%20\\(C%23%20Programming%20Guide\\).md).  \n  \n In Visual Basic, dynamic operations are supported by late binding. For more information, see [Early and Late Binding](../Topic/Early%20and%20Late%20Binding%20\\(Visual%20Basic\\).md).  \n  \n The following code example demonstrates how to create an instance of a class that is derived from the `DynamicObject` class.  \n  \n```c#  \npublic class SampleDynamicObject : DynamicObject {}  \n//...  \ndynamic sampleObject = new SampleDynamicObject ();  \n```  \n  \n```vb#  \nPublic Class SampleDynamicObject   \n    Inherits DynamicObject  \n'...  \nDim sampleObject As Object = New SampleDynamicObject()  \n```  \n  \n You can also add your own members to classes derived from the `DynamicObject` class. If your class defines properties and also overrides the <xref:System.Dynamic.DynamicObject.TrySetMember%2A> method, the dynamic language runtime (DLR) first uses the language binder to look for a static definition of a property in the class. If there is no such property, the DLR calls the <xref:System.Dynamic.DynamicObject.TrySetMember%2A> method.  \n  \n The `DynamicObject` class implements the DLR interface <xref:System.Dynamic.IDynamicMetaObjectProvider>, which enables you to share instances of the `DynamicObject` class between languages that support the DLR interoperability model. For example, you can create an instance of the `DynamicObject` class in C# and then pass it to an IronPython function. For more information, see [Dynamic Language Runtime Overview](../Topic/Dynamic%20Language%20Runtime%20Overview.md) and documentation on the [CodePlex](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=141028) Web site.  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  If you have a simple scenario in which you need an object that can only add and remove members at run time but that does not need to define specific operations and does not have static members, use the <xref:System.Dynamic.ExpandoObject> class.  \n>   \n>  If you have a more advanced scenario in which you need to define how dynamic objects participate in the interoperability protocol, or you need to manage DLR fast dynamic dispatch caching, create your own implementation of the <xref:System.Dynamic.IDynamicMetaObjectProvider> interface."
  example:
  - "Assume that you want to provide alternative syntax for accessing values in a dictionary, so that instead of writing `sampleDictionary[\"Text\"] = \"Sample text\"` (`sampleDictionary(\"Text\") = \"Sample text\"` in Visual Basic), you can write `sampleDictionary.Text = \"Sample text\"`. Also, you want this syntax to be case-insensitive, so that `sampleDictionary.Text` is equivalent to `sampleDictionary.text`.  \n  \n The following code example demonstrates the `DynamicDictionary` class, which is derived from the `DynamicObject` class. The `DynamicDictionary` class contains an object of the `Dictionary<string, object>` type (`Dictionary(Of String, Object)` in Visual Basic) to store the key-value pairs, and overrides the <xref:System.Dynamic.DynamicObject.TrySetMember%2A> and <xref:System.Dynamic.DynamicObject.TryGetMember%2A> methods to support the new syntax. It also provides a `Count` property, which shows how many dynamic properties the dictionary contains.  \n  \n [!CODE [System.Dynamic.DynamicObject#1](../CodeSnippet/VS_Snippets_CLR_System/system.dynamic.dynamicobject#1)]  \n  \n For more examples, see [Creating Wrappers with DynamicObject](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=169008) on the C# Frequently Asked Questions blog."
