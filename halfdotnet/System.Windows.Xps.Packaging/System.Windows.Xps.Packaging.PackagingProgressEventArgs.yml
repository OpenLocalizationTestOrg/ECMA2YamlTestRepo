  summary: Initializes a new instance of the <see cref="T:System.Windows.Xps.Packaging.PackagingProgressEventArgs"> class.
  remarks: "In certain situations and for specific types, multiple packaging progress events occur at the same time. These logically distinct, but temporally identical, events are combined into a single <xref:System.Windows.Xps.Serialization.XpsPackagingPolicy.PackagingProgressEvent> and  is more than 1. For example, when you print, font subsetting is performed every four pages. Each page must be cached until the subsetting is complete, and then all four <xref:System.Windows.Xps.Packaging.PackagingAction> events occur at the same time. The constructor for the resulting <xref:System.Windows.Xps.Packaging.PackagingProgressEventArgs> sets  to <xref:System.Windows.Xps.Packaging.PackagingAction> and sets  to 4.  \n  \n For example, if a package consists of a single four-page document that uses one font and no images or other resources, the sequence of events might occur as shown in the following table.  \n  \n **The sequence of events for a simple package**  \n  \n AddingDocumentSequence  \n 1  \n  \n AddingFixedDocument  \n 1  \n  \n AddingFixedPage  \n 1  \n  \n AddingFixedPage  \n 1  \n  \n AddingFixedPage  \n 1  \n  \n AddingFixedPage  \n 1  \n  \n FontAdded  \n 1  \n  \n FixedPageCompleted  \n 4  \n  \n FixedDocumentCompleted  \n 1  \n  \n DocumentSequenceCompleted  \n 1  \n  \n XpsDocumentCommitted  \n 1"
