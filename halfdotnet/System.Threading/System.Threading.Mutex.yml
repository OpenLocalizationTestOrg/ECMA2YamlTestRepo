  type: Class
  summary: A synchronization primitive that can also be used for interprocess synchronization.
  remarks: "> [!NOTE]\n>  To view the .NET Framework source code for this type, see the [Reference Source](http://referencesource.microsoft.com/#mscorlib/system/threading/mutex.cs#29b92e0e2832a8d6). You can browse through the source code online, download the reference for offline viewing, and step through the sources (including patches and updates) during debugging; see [instructions](http://referencesource.microsoft.com/).  \n  \n When two or more threads need to access a shared resource at the same time, the system needs a synchronization mechanism to ensure that only one thread at a time uses the resource. Mutex is a synchronization primitive that grants exclusive access to the shared resource to only one thread. If a thread acquires a mutex, the second thread that wants to acquire that mutex is suspended until the first thread releases the mutex.  \n  \n> [!IMPORTANT]\n>  This type implements the <xref:System.IDisposable> interface. When you have finished using the type, you should dispose of it either directly or indirectly. To dispose of the type directly, call its <xref:System.IDisposable.Dispose%2A> method in a `try`/`catch` block. To dispose of it indirectly, use a language construct such as `using` (in C#) or `Using` (in Visual Basic). For more information, see the “Using an Object that Implements IDisposable” section in the <xref:System.IDisposable> interface topic.  \n  \n You can use the <xref:System.Threading.WaitHandle.WaitOne%2A?displayProperty=fullName> method to request ownership of a mutex. The calling thread blocks until one of the following occurs:  \n  \n-   The mutex is signaled to indicate that it is not owned. When this happens, the <xref:System.Threading.WaitHandle.WaitOne%2A> method returns `true`, and the calling thread assumes ownership of the mutex and accesses the resource protected by the mutex. When it has finished accessing the resource, the thread must call the <xref:System.Threading.Mutex.ReleaseMutex%2A> method to release ownership of the mutex. The first example in the Examples section illustrates this pattern.  \n  \n-   The time-out interval specified in the call to a <xref:System.Threading.WaitHandle.WaitOne%2A> method that has a  or  parameter has elapsed. When this happens, the <xref:System.Threading.WaitHandle.WaitOne%2A> method returns `false`, and the calling thread makes no further attempt to acquire ownership of the mutex. In this case, you should structure your code so that access to the resource that is protected by the mutex is denied to the calling thread. Because the thread never acquired ownership of the mutex, it must not call the <xref:System.Threading.Mutex.ReleaseMutex%2A> method. The second example in the Examples section illustrates this pattern.  \n  \n The Mutex class enforces thread identity, so a mutex can be released only by the thread that acquired it. By contrast, the <xref:System.Threading.Semaphore> class does not enforce thread identity. A mutex can also be passed across application domain boundaries.  \n  \n The thread that owns a mutex can request the same mutex in repeated calls to <xref:System.Threading.WaitHandle.WaitOne%2A> without blocking its execution. However, the thread must call the <xref:System.Threading.Mutex.ReleaseMutex%2A> method the same number of times to release ownership of the mutex.  \n  \n Because the Mutex class inherits from <xref:System.Threading.WaitHandle>, you can also call the static <xref:System.Threading.WaitHandle.WaitAll%2A?displayProperty=fullName> and <xref:System.Threading.WaitHandle.WaitAny%2A?displayProperty=fullName> methods to synchronize access to a protected resource.  \n  \n If a thread terminates while owning a mutex, the mutex is said to be abandoned. The state of the mutex is set to signaled, and the next waiting thread gets ownership. Beginning in version 2.0 of the .NET Framework, an <xref:System.Threading.AbandonedMutexException> is thrown in the next thread that acquires the abandoned mutex. Before version 2.0 of the .NET Framework, no exception was thrown.  \n  \n> [!CAUTION]\n>  An abandoned mutex often indicates a serious error in the code. When a thread exits without releasing the mutex, the data structures protected by the mutex might not be in a consistent state. The next thread to request ownership of the mutex can handle this exception and proceed, if the integrity of the data structures can be verified.  \n  \n In the case of a system-wide mutex, an abandoned mutex might indicate that an application has been terminated abruptly (for example, by using Windows Task Manager).  \n  \n Mutexes are of two types: local mutexes, which are unnamed, and named system mutexes. A local mutex exists only within your process. It can be used by any thread in your process that has a reference to the Mutex object that represents the mutex. Each unnamed Mutex object represents a separate local mutex.  \n  \n Named system mutexes are visible throughout the operating system, and can be used to synchronize the activities of processes. You can create a Mutex object that represents a named system mutex by using a constructor that accepts a name. The operating-system object can be created at the same time, or it can exist before the creation of the Mutex object. You can create multiple Mutex objects that represent the same named system mutex, and you can use the <xref:System.Threading.Mutex.OpenExisting%2A> method to open an existing named system mutex.  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  On a server that is running Terminal Services, a named system mutex can have two levels of visibility. If its name begins with the prefix \"Global\\\\\", the mutex is visible in all terminal server sessions. If its name begins with the prefix \"Local\\\\\", the mutex is visible only in the terminal server session where it was created. In that case, a separate mutex with the same name can exist in each of the other terminal server sessions on the server. If you do not specify a prefix when you create a named mutex, it takes the prefix \"Local\\\\\". Within a terminal server session, two mutexes whose names differ only by their prefixes are separate mutexes, and both are visible to all processes in the terminal server session. That is, the prefix names \"Global\\\\\" and \"Local\\\\\" describe the scope of the mutex name relative to terminal server sessions, not relative to processes."
  example:
  - "This example shows how a local Mutex object is used to synchronize access to a protected resource. Because each calling thread is blocked until it acquires ownership of the mutex, it must call the <xref:System.Threading.Mutex.ReleaseMutex%2A> method to release ownership of the thread.  \n  \n [!CODE [System.Threading.Mutex.Class#1](../CodeSnippet/VS_Snippets_CLR_System/system.threading.mutex.class#1)]  \n  \n In the following example, each thread calls the <xref:System.Threading.WaitHandle.WaitOne%28System.Int32%29> method to acquire the mutex. If the time-out interval elapses, the method returns `false`, and the thread neither acquires the mutex nor gains access to the resource the mutex protects. The <xref:System.Threading.Mutex.ReleaseMutex%2A> method is called only by the thread that acquires the mutex.  \n  \n [!CODE [System.Threading.Mutex.Class#2](../CodeSnippet/VS_Snippets_CLR_System/system.threading.mutex.class#2)]"

  summary: Releases the <see cref="T:System.Threading.Mutex"> once.
  remarks: "Whenever a thread acquires a mutex (for example, by calling its <xref:System.Threading.WaitHandle.WaitOne%2A> method), it must subsequently call ReleaseMutex to relinquish ownership of the mutex and unblock other threads that are trying to gain ownership of the mutex. If the attempt to get ownership of the mutex fails (for example, when a call to the <xref:System.Threading.WaitHandle.WaitOne%2A> method with a  or a  parameter returns `false` because the request times out), the thread shouldn't call ReleaseMutex, In this case, the thread should also not be allowed to access the resource protected by the mutex, as the following example shows.  \n  \n [!CODE [System.Threading.Mutex.Class#2](../CodeSnippet/VS_Snippets_CLR_System/system.threading.mutex.class#2)]  \n  \n A thread that owns a mutex can specify the same mutex in repeated wait function calls without blocking its execution. The number of calls is kept by the common language runtime. The thread must call ReleaseMutex the same number of times to release ownership of the mutex.  \n  \n If a thread terminates while owning a mutex, the mutex is said to be abandoned. The state of the mutex is set to signaled and the next waiting thread gets ownership. If no one owns the mutex, the state of the mutex is signaled. Beginning in version 2.0 of the .NET Framework, an <xref:System.Threading.AbandonedMutexException> is thrown in the next thread that acquires the mutex. Prior to version 2.0 of the .NET Framework, no exception was thrown.  \n  \n> [!CAUTION]\n>  An abandoned mutex often indicates a serious error in the code. When a thread exits without releasing the mutex, the data structures protected by the mutex might not be in a consistent state. The next thread to request ownership of the mutex can handle this exception and proceed, if the integrity of the data structures can be verified.  \n  \n In the case of a system-wide mutex, an abandoned mutex might indicate that an application has been terminated abruptly (for example, by using Windows Task Manager)."
  example:
  - "The following example shows how a local <xref:System.Threading.Mutex> object is used to synchronize access to a protected resource. The thread that creates the mutex does not own it initially. The ReleaseMutex method is used to release the mutex when it is no longer needed.  \n  \n [!CODE [System.Threading.Mutex Default Ctor Example#1](../CodeSnippet/VS_Snippets_CLR_System/system.Threading.Mutex Default Ctor Example#1)]"
