  summary: Space is redistributed based on the value of the P:System.Windows.FrameworkElement.HorizontalAlignment?qualifyHint=False&autoUpgrade=True and P:System.Windows.FrameworkElement.VerticalAlignment?qualifyHint=False&autoUpgrade=True properties.
  remarks: "If the value of the P:System.Windows.Controls.GridSplitter.ResizeDirection?qualifyHint=False&autoUpgrade=True property specifies that space is redistributed between rows, the redistribution follows these guidelines:  \n  \n-   When the P:System.Windows.FrameworkElement.VerticalAlignment?qualifyHint=False&autoUpgrade=True property is set to F:System.Windows.VerticalAlignment.Top?qualifyHint=False&autoUpgrade=True, space is redistributed between the row that is specified for the T:System.Windows.Controls.GridSplitter?qualifyHint=False&autoUpgrade=True and the row that is above that row.  \n  \n-   When the P:System.Windows.FrameworkElement.VerticalAlignment?qualifyHint=False&autoUpgrade=True property is set to F:System.Windows.VerticalAlignment.Bottom?qualifyHint=False&autoUpgrade=True, space is redistributed between the row that is specified for the T:System.Windows.Controls.GridSplitter?qualifyHint=False&autoUpgrade=True and the row that is below that row.  \n  \n-   When the P:System.Windows.FrameworkElement.VerticalAlignment?qualifyHint=False&autoUpgrade=True property is set to F:System.Windows.VerticalAlignment.Center?qualifyHint=False&autoUpgrade=True, space is redistributed between the row that is above and the row that is below the row that is specified for the T:System.Windows.Controls.GridSplitter?qualifyHint=False&autoUpgrade=True.  \n  \n-   When the P:System.Windows.FrameworkElement.VerticalAlignment?qualifyHint=False&autoUpgrade=True property is set to F:System.Windows.VerticalAlignment.Stretch?qualifyHint=False&autoUpgrade=True, space is redistributed between the row that is above and the row that is below the row that is specified for the T:System.Windows.Controls.GridSplitter?qualifyHint=False&autoUpgrade=True.  \n  \n If the value of the P:System.Windows.Controls.GridSplitter.ResizeDirection?qualifyHint=False&autoUpgrade=True property specifies that space is redistributed between columns, the redistribution follows these guidelines:  \n  \n-   When the P:System.Windows.FrameworkElement.HorizontalAlignment?qualifyHint=False&autoUpgrade=True property is set to F:System.Windows.HorizontalAlignment.Left?qualifyHint=False&autoUpgrade=True, space is redistributed between the column that is specified for the T:System.Windows.Controls.GridSplitter?qualifyHint=False&autoUpgrade=True and the column that is to the left.  \n  \n-   When the P:System.Windows.FrameworkElement.HorizontalAlignment?qualifyHint=False&autoUpgrade=True property is set to F:System.Windows.HorizontalAlignment.Right?qualifyHint=False&autoUpgrade=True, space is redistributed between the column that is specified for the T:System.Windows.Controls.GridSplitter?qualifyHint=False&autoUpgrade=True and the column that is to the right.  \n  \n-   When the P:System.Windows.FrameworkElement.HorizontalAlignment?qualifyHint=False&autoUpgrade=True property is set to F:System.Windows.HorizontalAlignment.Center?qualifyHint=False&autoUpgrade=True, space is redistributed between the columns that are to the left and right of the column that is specified for the T:System.Windows.Controls.GridSplitter?qualifyHint=False&autoUpgrade=True.  \n  \n-   When the P:System.Windows.FrameworkElement.HorizontalAlignment?qualifyHint=False&autoUpgrade=True property is set to F:System.Windows.VerticalAlignment.Stretch?qualifyHint=False&autoUpgrade=True, space is redistributed between the columns that are to the left and right of the column that is specified for the T:System.Windows.Controls.GridSplitter?qualifyHint=False&autoUpgrade=True."
