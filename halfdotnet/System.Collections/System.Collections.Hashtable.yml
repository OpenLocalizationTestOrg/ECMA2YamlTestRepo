  summary: "Represents a collection of key/value pairs that are organized based on the hash code of the key.  \n  \n To browse the .NET Framework source code for this type, see the [Reference Source](http://referencesource.microsoft.com/#mscorlib/system/collections/hashtable.cs#10fefb6e0ae510dd)."
  remarks: "> [!NOTE]\n>  To view the .NET Framework source code for this type, see the [Reference Source](http://referencesource.microsoft.com/#mscorlib/system/collections/hashtable.cs#10fefb6e0ae510dd). You can browse through the source code online, download the reference for offline viewing, and step through the sources (including patches and updates) during debugging; see [instructions](http://referencesource.microsoft.com/).  \n  \n Each element is a key/value pair stored in a <xref:System.Collections.DictionaryEntry> object. A key cannot be `null`, but a value can be.  \n  \n The objects used as keys by a Hashtable are required to override the <xref:System.Object.GetHashCode%2A?displayProperty=fullName> method (or the <xref:System.Collections.IHashCodeProvider> interface) and the <xref:System.Object.Equals%2A?displayProperty=fullName> method (or the <xref:System.Collections.IComparer> interface). The implementation of both methods and interfaces must handle case sensitivity the same way; otherwise, the Hashtable might behave incorrectly. For example, when creating a Hashtable, you must use the <xref:System.Collections.CaseInsensitiveHashCodeProvider> class (or any case-insensitive <xref:System.Collections.IHashCodeProvider> implementation) with the <xref:System.Collections.CaseInsensitiveComparer> class (or any case-insensitive <xref:System.Collections.IComparer> implementation).  \n  \n Furthermore, these methods must produce the same results when called with the same parameters while the key exists in the Hashtable. An alternative is to use a Hashtable constructor with an <xref:System.Collections.IEqualityComparer> parameter. If key equality were simply reference equality, the inherited implementation of <xref:System.Object.GetHashCode%2A?displayProperty=fullName> and <xref:System.Object.Equals%2A?displayProperty=fullName> would suffice.  \n  \n Key objects must be immutable as long as they are used as keys in the Hashtable.  \n  \n When an element is added to the Hashtable, the element is placed into a bucket based on the hash code of the key. Subsequent lookups of the key use the hash code of the key to search in only one particular bucket, thus substantially reducing the number of key comparisons required to find an element.  \n  \n The load factor of a Hashtable determines the maximum ratio of elements to buckets. Smaller load factors cause faster average lookup times at the cost of increased memory consumption. The default load factor of 1.0 generally provides the best balance between speed and size. A different load factor can also be specified when the Hashtable is created.  \n  \n As elements are added to a Hashtable, the actual load factor of the Hashtable increases. When the actual load factor reaches the specified load factor, the number of buckets in the Hashtable is automatically increased to the smallest prime number that is larger than twice the current number of Hashtable buckets.  \n  \n Each key object in the Hashtable must provide its own hash function, which can be accessed by calling <xref:System.Collections.Hashtable.GetHash%2A>. However, any object implementing <xref:System.Collections.IHashCodeProvider> can be passed to a Hashtable constructor, and that hash function is used for all objects in the table.  \n  \n The capacity of a Hashtable is the number of elements the Hashtable can hold. As elements are added to a Hashtable, the capacity is automatically increased as required through reallocation.  \n  \n For very large Hashtable objects, you can increase the maximum capacity to 2 billion elements on a 64-bit system by setting the `enabled` attribute of the  configuration element to `true` in the run-time environment.  \n  \n The `foreach` statement of the C# language (`For Each` in Visual Basic) returns an object of the type of the elements in the collection. Since each element of the Hashtable is a key/value pair, the element type is not the type of the key or the type of the value. Instead, the element type is <xref:System.Collections.DictionaryEntry>. For example:  \n  \n [!CODE [System.Collections.Hashtable_ClassExample#01](../CodeSnippet/VS_Snippets_CLR_System/system.Collections.Hashtable_ClassExample#01)]  \n  \n The `foreach` statement is a wrapper around the enumerator, which only allows reading from, not writing to, the collection.  \n  \n Because serializing and deserializing an enumerator for a Hashtable can cause the elements to become reordered, it is not possible to continue enumeration without calling the <xref:System.Collections.IEnumerator.Reset%2A> method.  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  Because keys can be inherited and their behavior changed, their absolute uniqueness cannot be guaranteed by comparisons using the <xref:System.Type.Equals%2A> method."

  summary: Initializes a new, empty instance of the <see cref="T:System.Collections.Hashtable"> class using the specified initial capacity, load factor, hash code provider, and comparer.
  remarks: "Specifying the initial capacity eliminates the need to perform a number of resizing operations while adding elements to the <xref:System.Collections.Hashtable> object. Capacity is automatically increased as required based on the load factor.  \n  \n The load factor is the maximum ratio of elements to buckets. A smaller load factor means faster lookup at the cost of increased memory consumption. A load factor of 1.0 is the best balance between speed and size.  \n  \n When the actual load factor reaches the specified load factor, the number of buckets is automatically increased to the smallest prime number that is larger than twice the current number of buckets.  \n  \n The hash code provider dispenses hash codes for keys in the <xref:System.Collections.Hashtable>. The default hash code provider is the key's implementation of <xref:System.Object.GetHashCode%2A?displayProperty=fullName>.  \n  \n The comparer determines whether two keys are equal. Every key in a <xref:System.Collections.Hashtable> must be unique. The default comparer is the key's implementation of <xref:System.Object.Equals%2A?displayProperty=fullName>.  \n  \n The custom hash code provider and the custom comparer enable scenarios such as doing lookups with case-insensitive strings.  \n  \n This constructor is an O() operation, where  is the  parameter."

  summary: Adds an element with the specified key and value into the <see cref="T:System.Collections.Hashtable">.
  remarks: "A key cannot be `null`, but a value can be.  \n  \n An object that has no correlation between its state and its hash code value should typically not be used as the key. For example, String objects are better than StringBuilder objects for use as keys.  \n  \n You can also use the <xref:System.Collections.Hashtable.Item%2A> property to add new elements by setting the value of a key that does not exist in the <xref:System.Collections.Hashtable>; for example, `myCollection[\"myNonexistentKey\"] = myValue`. However, if the specified key already exists in the <xref:System.Collections.Hashtable>, setting the <xref:System.Collections.Hashtable.Item%2A> property overwrites the old value. In contrast, the Add method does not modify existing elements.  \n  \n If <xref:System.Collections.Hashtable.Count%2A> is less than the capacity of the <xref:System.Collections.Hashtable>, this method is an O(1) operation. If the capacity needs to be increased to accommodate the new element, this method becomes an O() operation, where  is <xref:System.Collections.Hashtable.Count%2A>."

  summary: Returns an <see cref="T:System.Collections.IDictionaryEnumerator"> that iterates through the <xref:System.Collections.Hashtable>.
  remarks: "[Visual Basic, C#]  \n  \n The `foreach` statement of the C# language (`for each` in Visual Basic) hides the complexity of the enumerators.  Therefore, using `foreach` is recommended, instead of directly manipulating the enumerator.  \n  \n Enumerators can be used to read the data in the collection, but they cannot be used to modify the underlying collection.  \n  \n Initially, the enumerator is positioned before the first element in the collection. <xref:System.Collections.IEnumerator.Reset%2A> also brings the enumerator back to this position.  At this position, <xref:System.Collections.IEnumerator.Current%2A> is undefined. Therefore, you must call <xref:System.Collections.IEnumerator.MoveNext%2A> to advance the enumerator to the first element of the collection before reading the value of <xref:System.Collections.IEnumerator.Current%2A>.  \n  \n <xref:System.Collections.IEnumerator.Current%2A> returns the same object until either <xref:System.Collections.IEnumerator.MoveNext%2A> or <xref:System.Collections.IEnumerator.Reset%2A> is called. <xref:System.Collections.IEnumerator.MoveNext%2A> sets <xref:System.Collections.IEnumerator.Current%2A> to the next element.  \n  \n If <xref:System.Collections.IEnumerator.MoveNext%2A> passes the end of the collection, the enumerator is positioned after the last element in the collection and <xref:System.Collections.IEnumerator.MoveNext%2A> returns `false`. When the enumerator is at this position, subsequent calls to <xref:System.Collections.IEnumerator.MoveNext%2A> also return `false`. If the last call to <xref:System.Collections.IEnumerator.MoveNext%2A> returned `false`, <xref:System.Collections.IEnumerator.Current%2A> is undefined. To set <xref:System.Collections.IEnumerator.Current%2A> to the first element of the collection again, you can call <xref:System.Collections.IEnumerator.Reset%2A> followed by <xref:System.Collections.IEnumerator.MoveNext%2A>.  \n  \n An enumerator remains valid as long as the collection remains unchanged. If changes are made to the collection, such as adding, modifying, or deleting elements, the enumerator is irrecoverably invalidated and its behavior is undefined.  \n  \n The enumerator does not have exclusive access to the collection; therefore, enumerating through a collection is intrinsically not a thread safe procedure.  To guarantee thread safety during enumeration, you can lock the collection during the entire enumeration.  To allow the collection to be accessed by multiple threads for reading and writing, you must implement your own synchronization.  \n  \n This method is an O(1) operation.  \n  \n Because serializing and deserializing an enumerator for a <xref:System.Collections.Hashtable> can cause the elements to become reordered, it is not possible to continue enumeration without calling the <xref:System.Collections.IEnumerator.Reset%2A> method."

  remarks: "A <xref:System.Collections.Hashtable> can support one writer and multiple readers concurrently. To support multiple writers, all operations must be done through the wrapper returned by the <xref:System.Collections.Hashtable.Synchronized%2A> method.  \n  \n Enumerating through a collection is intrinsically not a thread safe procedure. Even when a collection is synchronized, other threads can still modify the collection, which causes the enumerator to throw an exception. To guarantee thread safety during enumeration, you can either lock the collection during the entire enumeration or catch the exceptions resulting from changes made by other threads.  \n  \n The following code example shows how to lock the collection using the <xref:System.Collections.Hashtable.SyncRoot%2A> during the entire enumeration:  \n  \n [!CODE [Classic Hashtable.IsSynchronized Example#2](../CodeSnippet/VS_Snippets_CLR_Classic/classic Hashtable.IsSynchronized Example#2)]"

  summary: Gets or sets the value associated with the specified key.
  remarks: "This property provides the ability to access a specific element in the collection by using the following syntax: `myCollection[key]`.  \n  \n You can also use the Item property to add new elements by setting the value of a key that does not exist in the <xref:System.Collections.Hashtable>; for example, `myCollection[\"myNonexistentKey\"] = myValue`. However, if the specified key already exists in the <xref:System.Collections.Hashtable>, setting the Item property overwrites the old value. In contrast, the <xref:System.Collections.Hashtable.Add%2A> method does not modify existing elements.  \n  \n A key cannot be `null`, but a value can be. To distinguish between `null` that is returned because the specified key is not found and `null` that is returned because the value of the specified key is `null`, use the <xref:System.Collections.Hashtable.Contains%2A> method or the <xref:System.Collections.Hashtable.ContainsKey%2A> method to determine if the key exists in the list.  \n  \n Retrieving the value of this property is an O(1) operation; setting the property is also an O(1) operation.  \n  \n The C# language uses the  keyword to define the indexers instead of implementing the <xref:System.Collections.IList.Item%2A> property. Visual Basic implements Item as a default property, which provides the same indexing functionality."

  summary: Returns an enumerator that iterates through a collection.
  remarks: "[Visual Basic, C#]  \n  \n The `foreach` statement of the C# language (`for each` in Visual Basic) hides the complexity of the enumerators.  Therefore, using `foreach` is recommended, instead of directly manipulating the enumerator.  \n  \n Enumerators can be used to read the data in the collection, but they cannot be used to modify the underlying collection.  \n  \n Initially, the enumerator is positioned before the first element in the collection. <xref:System.Collections.IEnumerator.Reset%2A> also brings the enumerator back to this position. At this position, calling <xref:System.Collections.IEnumerator.Current%2A> throws an exception. Therefore, you must call <xref:System.Collections.IEnumerator.MoveNext%2A> to advance the enumerator to the first element of the collection before reading the value of <xref:System.Collections.IEnumerator.Current%2A>.  \n  \n <xref:System.Collections.IEnumerator.Current%2A> returns the same object until either <xref:System.Collections.IEnumerator.MoveNext%2A> or <xref:System.Collections.IEnumerator.Reset%2A> is called. <xref:System.Collections.IEnumerator.MoveNext%2A> sets <xref:System.Collections.IEnumerator.Current%2A> to the next element.  \n  \n If <xref:System.Collections.IEnumerator.MoveNext%2A> passes the end of the collection, the enumerator is positioned after the last element in the collection and <xref:System.Collections.IEnumerator.MoveNext%2A> returns `false`. When the enumerator is at this position, subsequent calls to <xref:System.Collections.IEnumerator.MoveNext%2A> also return `false`. If the last call to <xref:System.Collections.IEnumerator.MoveNext%2A> returned `false`, calling <xref:System.Collections.IEnumerator.Current%2A> throws an exception. To set <xref:System.Collections.IEnumerator.Current%2A> to the first element of the collection again, you can call <xref:System.Collections.IEnumerator.Reset%2A> followed by <xref:System.Collections.IEnumerator.MoveNext%2A>.  \n  \n An enumerator remains valid as long as the collection remains unchanged. If changes are made to the collection, such as adding, modifying, or deleting elements, the enumerator can be invalidated and the next call to <xref:System.Collections.IEnumerator.MoveNext%2A> or <xref:System.Collections.IEnumerator.Reset%2A> throws an <xref:System.InvalidOperationException>. If the collection is modified between <xref:System.Collections.IEnumerator.MoveNext%2A> and <xref:System.Collections.IEnumerator.Current%2A>, <xref:System.Collections.IEnumerator.Current%2A> returns the element that it is set to, even if the enumerator is already invalidated.  \n  \n The enumerator does not have exclusive access to the collection; therefore, enumerating through a collection is intrinsically not a thread safe procedure. Even when a collection is synchronized, other threads can still modify the collection, which causes the enumerator to throw an exception. To guarantee thread safety during enumeration, you can either lock the collection during the entire enumeration or catch the exceptions resulting from changes made by other threads.  \n  \n This method is an O(1) operation."
