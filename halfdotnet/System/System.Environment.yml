  summary: Terminates this process and returns an exit code to the operating system.
  remarks: "For the  parameter, use a non-zero number to indicate an error. In your application, you can define your own error codes in an enumeration, and return the appropriate error code based on the scenario. For example, return a value of 1 to indicate that the required file is not present, and a value of 2 to indicate that the file is in the wrong format. For a list of exit codes used by the Windows operating system, see [System Error Codes](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ms681381.aspx) in the Windows documentation.  \n  \n Calling the Exit method differs from using your programming language's `return` statement in the following ways:  \n  \n-   Exit always terminates an application. Using the `return` statement may terminate an application only if it is used in the application entry point, such as in the `Main` method.  \n  \n-   Exit terminates an application immediately, even if other threads are running. If the `return` statement is called in the application entry point, it causes an application to terminate only after all foreground threads have terminated.  \n  \n-   Exit requires the caller to have permission to call unmanaged code. The `return` statement does not.  \n  \n-   If Exit is called from a `try` or `catch` block, the code in any `finally` block does not execute. If the `return` statement is used, the code in the `finally` block does execute.  \n  \n-   If Exit is called when code in a [constrained execution region](../Topic/Constrained%20Execution%20Regions.md) (CER) is running, the CER will not complete execution. If the `return` statement is used, the CER completes execution."

  remarks: "If the `Main` method returns `void`, you can use this property to set the exit code that will be returned to the calling environment. If `Main` does not return `void`, this property is ignored. The initial value of this property is zero.  \n  \n> [!WARNING]\n>  The ExitCode property is a signed 32-bit integer. To prevent the property from returning a negative exit code, you should not use values greater than or equal to 0x80000000.  \n  \n Use a non-zero number to indicate an error. In your application, you can define your own error codes in an enumeration, and return the appropriate error code based on the scenario. For example, return a value of 1 to indicate that the required file is not present and a value of 2 to indicate that the file is in the wrong format. For a list of exit codes used by the Windows operating system, see [System Error Codes](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ms681381\\(v=vs.85\\)) in the Windows documentation."

Use the UserDomainName property to obtain the user's domain name without the user name, and the <xref:System.Environment.UserName%2A> property to obtain the user name without the domain name.  For example, if a user's domain name and user name are CORPORATENETWORK\\john, the UserDomainName property returns \"CORPORATENETWORK\".  \n  \n The UserDomainName property first attempts to get the domain name component of the Windows account name for the current user. If that attempt fails, this property attempts to get the domain name associated with the user name provided by the <xref:System.Environment.UserName%2A> property. If that attempt fails because the host computer is not joined to a domain, then the host computer name is returned."

  summary: Gets a value indicating whether the current process is running in user interactive mode.
  remarks: The UserInteractive property reports `false` for a Windows process or a service like IIS that runs without a user interface. If this property is `false`, do not display modal dialogs or message boxes because there is no graphical user interface for the user to interact with.
  example:
  - "The following example displays whether the current process is running in user interactive mode.  \n  \n [!CODE [Environment.UserInteractive#1](../CodeSnippet/VS_Snippets_CLR/Environment.UserInteractive#1)]"

  summary: Gets the user name of the person who is currently logged on to the Windows operating system.
  remarks: "You can use the UserName property to identify the user on the current thread, to the system and application for security or access purposes. It can also be used to customize a particular application for each user.  \n  \n The UserName property wraps a call to the Windows [GetUserName](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/ms724432.aspx) function. The domain account credentials for a user are formatted as the user's domain name, the '\\\\' character, and user name. Use the <xref:System.Environment.UserDomainName%2A> property to obtain the user's domain name and the UserName property to obtain the user name.  \n  \n If an ASP.NET application runs in a development environment, the UserName property returns the name of the current user. In a published ASP.NET application, this property returns the name of the application pool account (such as Default AppPool)."
