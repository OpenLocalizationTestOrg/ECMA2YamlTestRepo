  summary: Specifies the day of the week.
  remarks: "The DayOfWeek enumeration represents the day of the week in calendars that have seven days per week. The value of the constants in this enumeration ranges from F:System.DayOfWeek.Sunday?qualifyHint=True&autoUpgrade=True to F:System.DayOfWeek.Saturday?qualifyHint=True&autoUpgrade=True. If cast to an integer, its value ranges from zero (which indicates F:System.DayOfWeek.Sunday?qualifyHint=True&autoUpgrade=True) to six (which indicates F:System.DayOfWeek.Saturday?qualifyHint=True&autoUpgrade=True).  \n  \n This enumeration is useful when it is desirable to have a strongly typed specification of the day of the week. For example, this enumeration is the type of the property value for the P:System.DateTime.DayOfWeek?qualifyHint=True&autoUpgrade=True property.  \n  \n The members of the DayOfWeek enumeration are not localized. To return the localized name of the day of the week, call the M:System.DateTime.ToString(System.String)?qualifyHint=True&autoUpgrade=False or the M:System.DateTime.ToString(System.String,System.IFormatProvider)?qualifyHint=True&autoUpgrade=False method with either the \"ddd\" or \"dddd\" format strings. The former format string produces the abbreviated weekday name; the latter produces the full weekday name."
  example:
  - "The following example demonstrates the P:System.DateTime.DayOfWeek?qualifyHint=True&autoUpgrade=True property and the DayOfWeek enumeration.  \n  \n [!CODE [DateTime.DayOfWeek#1](../CodeSnippet/VS_Snippets_CLR/DateTime.DayOfWeek#1)]"
