  summary: Provides information about the current registration for notification of the next full garbage collection.
  remarks: Use the <xref:System.GC.RegisterForFullGCNotification%2A> method to register for a full garbage collection notification. Then use the <xref:System.GC.WaitForFullGCApproach%2A> method or the <xref:System.GC.WaitForFullGCComplete%2A> method to return a GCNotificationStatus enumeration that contains the status of the notification.
  example:
  - "The following example obtains a GCNotificationStatus enumeration from the <xref:System.GC.WaitForFullGCApproach%2A> method. If the enumeration returns F:System.GCNotificationStatus.Succeeded?qualifyHint=False&autoUpgrade=True, it calls the custom method `OnFullGCApproachNotify` to perform actions in response to the approaching full garbage collection. This code example is part of a larger example provided for [Garbage Collection Notifications](../Topic/Garbage%20Collection%20Notifications.md) topic.  \n  \n [!CODE [GCNotification#8](../CodeSnippet/VS_Snippets_CLR/GCNotification#8)]"
