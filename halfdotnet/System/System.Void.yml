  summary: Specifies a return value type for a method that does not return a value.
  remarks: The Void structure is used in the <xref:System.Reflection?displayProperty=fullName> namespace, but is rarely useful in a typical application. The Void structure has no members other than the ones all types inherit from the <xref:System.Object> class.
