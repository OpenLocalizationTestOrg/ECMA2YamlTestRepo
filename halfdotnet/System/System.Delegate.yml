  type: Class
  summary: Represents a delegate, which is a data structure that refers to a static method or to a class instance and an instance method of that class.
  remarks: "The Delegate class is the base class for delegate types. However, only the system and compilers can derive explicitly from the Delegate class or from the <xref:System.MulticastDelegate> class. It is also not permissible to derive a new type from a delegate type. The Delegate class is not considered a delegate type; it is a class used to derive delegate types.  \n  \n Most languages implement a `delegate` keyword, and compilers for those languages are able to derive from the <xref:System.MulticastDelegate> class; therefore, users should use the `delegate` keyword provided by the language.  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  The common language runtime provides an `Invoke` method for each delegate type, with the same signature as the delegate. You do not have to call this method explicitly from C#, Visual Basic, or Visual C++, because the compilers call it automatically. The `Invoke` method is useful in [reflection](../Topic/Reflection%20in%20the%20.NET%20Framework.md) when you want to find the signature of the delegate type.  \n  \n The common language runtime provides each delegate type with `BeginInvoke` and `EndInvoke` methods, to enable asynchronous invocation of the delegate. For more information about these methods, see [Calling Synchronous Methods Asynchronously](../Topic/Calling%20Synchronous%20Methods%20Asynchronously.md).  \n  \n The declaration of a delegate type establishes a contract that specifies the signature of one or more methods. A delegate is an instance of a delegate type that has references to:  \n  \n-   An instance method of a type and a target object assignable to that type.  \n  \n-   An instance method of a type, with the hidden  parameter exposed in the formal parameter list. The delegate is said to be an open instance delegate.  \n  \n-   A static method.  \n  \n-   A static method and a target object assignable to the first parameter of the method. The delegate is said to be closed over its first argument.  \n  \n For more information on delegate binding, see the <xref:System.Delegate.CreateDelegate%28System.Type%2CSystem.Object%2CSystem.Reflection.MethodInfo%2CSystem.Boolean%29> method overload.  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  In the .NET Framework versions 1.0 and 1.1, a delegate can represent a method only if the signature of the method exactly matches the signature specified by the delegate type. Thus, only the first and third bullets in the preceding list are supported, and the first bullet requires an exact type match.  \n  \n When a delegate represents an instance method closed over its first argument (the most common case), the delegate stores a reference to the method's entry point and a reference to an object, called the target, which is of a type assignable to the type that defined the method. When a delegate represents an open instance method, it stores a reference to the method's entry point. The delegate signature must include the hidden  parameter in its formal parameter list; in this case, the delegate does not have a reference to a target object, and a target object must be supplied when the delegate is invoked.  \n  \n When a delegate represents a static method, the delegate stores a reference to the method's entry point. When a delegate represents a static method closed over its first argument, the delegate stores a reference to the method's entry point and a reference to a target object assignable to the type of the method's first argument. When the delegate is invoked, the first argument of the static method receives the target object.  \n  \n The invocation list of a delegate is an ordered set of delegates in which each element of the list invokes exactly one of the methods represented by the delegate. An invocation list can contain duplicate methods. During an invocation, methods are invoked in the order in which they appear in the invocation list. A delegate attempts to invoke every method in its invocation list; duplicates are invoked once for each time they appear in the invocation list. Delegates are immutable; once created, the invocation list of a delegate does not change.  \n  \n Delegates are referred to as multicast, or combinable, because a delegate can invoke one or more methods and can be used in combining operations.  \n  \n Combining operations, such as <xref:System.Delegate.Combine%2A> and <xref:System.Delegate.Remove%2A>, do not alter existing delegates. Instead, such an operation returns a new delegate that contains the results of the operation, an unchanged delegate, or `null`. A combining operation returns `null` when the result of the operation is a delegate that does not reference at least one method. A combining operation returns an unchanged delegate when the requested operation has no effect.  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  Managed languages use the <xref:System.Delegate.Combine%2A> and <xref:System.Delegate.Remove%2A> methods to implement delegate operations. Examples include the `AddHandler` and `RemoveHandler` statements in Visual Basic and the += and -= operators on delegate types in C#.  \n  \n Starting with the [!INCLUDE[net_v40_long](../../add/includes/net-v40-long-md.md)], generic delegate types can have variant type parameters. Contravariant type parameters can be used as parameter types of the delegate, and a covariant type parameter can be used as the return type. This feature allows generic delegate types that are constructed from the same generic type definition to be assignment-compatible if their type arguments are reference types with an inheritance relationship, as explained in [Covariance and Contravariance](../Topic/Covariance%20and%20Contravariance%20in%20Generics.md).  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  Generic delegates that are assignment-compatible because of variance are not necessarily combinable. To be combinable, the types must match exactly. For example, suppose that a class named `Derived` is derived from a class named `Base`. A delegate of type `Action<Base>` (`Action(Of Base)` in Visual Basic) can be assigned to a variable of type `Action<Derived>`, but the two delegates cannot be combined because the types do not match exactly.  \n  \n If an invoked method throws an exception, the method stops executing, the exception is passed back to the caller of the delegate, and remaining methods in the invocation list are not invoked. Catching the exception in the caller does not alter this behavior.  \n  \n When the signature of the methods invoked by a delegate includes a return value, the delegate returns the return value of the last element in the invocation list. When the signature includes a parameter that is passed by reference, the final value of the parameter is the result of every method in the invocation list executing sequentially and updating the parameter's value.  \n  \n The closest equivalent of a delegate in C or C++ is a function pointer. A delegate can represent a static method or an instance method. When the delegate represents an instance method, the delegate stores not only a reference to the method's entry point, but also a reference to the class instance. Unlike function pointers, delegates are object oriented and type safe."
  example:
  - "The following example shows how to define a delegate named `myMethodDelegate`. Instances of this delegate are created for an instance method and a static method of the nested `mySampleClass` class. The delegate for the instance method requires an instance of `mySampleClass`. The `mySampleClass` instance is saved in a variable named `mySC`.  \n  \n [!CODE [Classic Delegate Example#1](../CodeSnippet/VS_Snippets_CLR_Classic/classic Delegate Example#1)]"

  summary: Creates a delegate of the specified type to represent the specified static method.
  remarks: "In the .NET Framework version 1.0 and 1.1, this method overload creates delegates for static methods only. In the .NET Framework version 2.0, this method overload also can create open instance method delegates; that is, delegates that explicitly supply the hidden first argument of instance methods. For a detailed explanation, see the more general <xref:System.Delegate.CreateDelegate%28System.Type%2CSystem.Object%2CSystem.Reflection.MethodInfo%29> method overload, which allows you to create all combinations of open or closed delegates for instance or static methods, and optionally to specify a first argument.  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  This method overload should be used when the delegate is not closed over its first argument, because it is somewhat faster in that case.  \n  \n This method overload is equivalent to calling the <xref:System.Delegate.CreateDelegate%28System.Type%2CSystem.Reflection.MethodInfo%2CSystem.Boolean%29> method overload and specifying `true` for .  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  Starting with the [!INCLUDE[net_v20sp1_long](../../add/includes/net-v20sp1-long-md.md)], this method can be used to access non-public methods if the caller has been granted <xref:System.Security.Permissions.ReflectionPermission> with the <xref:System.Security.Permissions.ReflectionPermissionFlag?displayProperty=fullName> flag and if the grant set of the non-public methods is restricted to the caller’s grant set, or a subset thereof. (See [Security Considerations for Reflection](../Topic/Security%20Considerations%20for%20Reflection.md).)  \n>   \n>  To use this functionality, your application should target the [!INCLUDE[net_v35_long](../../add/includes/net-v35-long-md.md)] or later.  \n  \n## Compatible Parameter Types and Return Type  \n In the .NET Framework version 2.0, the parameter types and return type of a delegate created using this method overload must be compatible with the parameter types and return type of the method the delegate represents; the types do not have to match exactly. This represents a relaxation of the binding behavior in the .NET Framework version 1.0 and 1.1, where the types must match exactly.  \n  \n A parameter of a delegate is compatible with the corresponding parameter of a method if the type of the delegate parameter is more restrictive than the type of the method parameter, because this guarantees that an argument passed to the delegate can be passed safely to the method.  \n  \n Similarly, the return type of a delegate is compatible with the return type of a method if the return type of the method is more restrictive than the return type of the delegate, because this guarantees that the return value of the method can be cast safely to the return type of the delegate.  \n  \n For example, a delegate with a parameter of type <xref:System.Collections.Hashtable> and a return type of <xref:System.Object> can represent a method with a parameter of type <xref:System.Object> and a return value of type <xref:System.Collections.Hashtable>."
  example:
  - "This section contains two code examples. The first example demonstrates the two kinds of delegates that can be created with this method overload: open over an instance method and open over a static method.  \n  \n The second code example demonstrates compatible parameter types and return types.  \n  \n **Example 1**  \n  \n The following code example demonstrates the two ways a delegate can be created using this overload of the <xref:System.Delegate.CreateDelegate%2A> method.  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  There are two overloads of the <xref:System.Delegate.CreateDelegate%2A> method that specify a <xref:System.Reflection.MethodInfo> but not a first argument; their functionality is the same except that one allows you to specify whether to throw on failure to bind, and the other always throws. This code example uses both overloads.  \n  \n The example declares a class `C` with a static method `M2` and an instance method `M1`, and two delegate types: `D1` takes an instance of `C` and a string, and `D2` takes a string.  \n  \n A second class named `Example` contains the code that creates the delegates.  \n  \n-   A delegate of type `D1`, representing an open instance method, is created for the instance method `M1`. An instance must be passed when the delegate is invoked.  \n  \n-   A delegate of type `D2`, representing an open static method, is created for the static method `M2`.  \n  \n [!CODE [Delegate.CreateDelegateTOM#1](../CodeSnippet/VS_Snippets_CLR/Delegate.CreateDelegateTOM#1)]  \n  \n **Example 2**  \n  \n The following code example demonstrates compatibility of parameter types and return types.  \n  \n The code example defines a base class named `Base` and a class named `Derived` that derives from `Base`. The derived class has a `static` (`Shared` in Visual Basic) method named `MyMethod` with one parameter of type `Base` and a return type of `Derived`. The code example also defines a delegate named `Example` that has one parameter of type `Derived` and a return type of `Base`.  \n  \n The code example demonstrates that the delegate named `Example` can be used to represent the method `MyMethod`. The method can be bound to the delegate because:  \n  \n-   The parameter type of the delegate (`Derived`) is more restrictive than the parameter type of `MyMethod` (`Base`), so that it is always safe to pass the argument of the delegate to `MyMethod`.  \n  \n-   The return type of `MyMethod` (`Derived`) is more restrictive than the parameter type of the delegate (`Base`), so that it is always safe to cast the return type of the method to the return type of the delegate.  \n  \n The code example produces no output.  \n  \n [!CODE [Delegate.CreateDelegate_RelaxedFit#1](../CodeSnippet/VS_Snippets_CLR/Delegate.CreateDelegate_RelaxedFit#1)]"

Consider a delegate type `D` with one argument of type `C`. The following describes the methods `D` can represent, ignoring the return type since it must match in all cases:  \n  \n-   `D` can represent any instance method that has exactly one argument of type `C`, regardless of what type the instance method belongs to. When <xref:System.Delegate.CreateDelegate%2A> is called,  is an instance of the type  belongs to, and the resulting delegate is said to be closed over that instance. (Trivially, `D` can also be closed over a null reference if  is a null reference.)  \n  \n-   `D` can represent an instance method of `C` that has no arguments. When <xref:System.Delegate.CreateDelegate%2A> is called,  is a null reference. The resulting delegate represents an open instance method, and an instance of `C` must be supplied each time it is invoked.  \n  \n-   `D` can represent a static method that takes one argument of type `C`, and that method can belong to any type. When <xref:System.Delegate.CreateDelegate%2A> is called,  is a null reference. The resulting delegate represents an open static method, and an instance of `C` must be supplied each time it is invoked.  \n  \n-   `D` can represent a static method that belongs to type `F` and has two arguments, of type `F` and type `C`. When <xref:System.Delegate.CreateDelegate%2A> is called,  is an instance of `F`. The resulting delegate represents a static method that is closed over that instance of `F`. Note that in the case where `F` and `C` are the same type, the static method has two arguments of that type. (In this case, `D` is closed over a null reference if  is a null reference.)"
  example:
  - "This section contains three code examples. The first example demonstrates the four kinds of delegates that can be created: closed over an instance method, open over an instance method, open over a static method, and closed over a static method.  \n  \n The second code example demonstrates compatible parameter types and return types.  \n  \n The third code example defines a single delegate type, and shows all the methods that delegate type can represent.  \n  \n **Example 1**  \n  \n The following code example demonstrates the four ways a delegate can be created using this overload of the <xref:System.Delegate.CreateDelegate%2A> method.  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  There are two overloads of the <xref:System.Delegate.CreateDelegate%2A> method that specify  and a <xref:System.Reflection.MethodInfo>; their functionality is the same except that one allows you to specify whether to throw on failure to bind, and the other always throws. This code example uses both overloads.  \n  \n The example declares a class `C` with a static method `M2` and an instance method `M1`, and three delegate types: `D1` takes an instance of `C` and a string, `D2` takes a string, and `D3` has no arguments.  \n  \n A second class named `Example` contains the code that creates the delegates.  \n  \n-   A delegate of type `D2`, closed over an instance of `C`, is created for the instance method `M1`. It is invoked with different strings, to show that the bound instance of `C` is always used.  \n  \n-   A delegate of type `D1`, representing an open instance method, is created for the instance method `M1`. An instance must be passed when the delegate is invoked.  \n  \n-   A delegate of type `D2`, representing an open static method, is created for the static method `M2`.  \n  \n-   Finally, a delegate of type `D3`, closed over a string, is created for the static method `M2`. The method is invoked to show that it uses the bound string.  \n  \n [!CODE [Delegate.CreateDelegateTOM#1](../CodeSnippet/VS_Snippets_CLR/Delegate.CreateDelegateTOM#1)]  \n  \n **Example 2**  \n  \n The following code example demonstrates compatibility of parameter types and return types.  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  This code example uses the <xref:System.Delegate.CreateDelegate%28System.Type%2CSystem.Reflection.MethodInfo%29> method overload. The use of other overloads that take <xref:System.Reflection.MethodInfo> is similar.  \n  \n The code example defines a base class named `Base` and a class named `Derived` that derives from `Base`. The derived class has a `static` (`Shared` in Visual Basic) method named `MyMethod` with one parameter of type `Base` and a return type of `Derived`. The code example also defines a delegate named `Example` that has one parameter of type `Derived` and a return type of `Base`.  \n  \n The code example demonstrates that the delegate named `Example` can be used to represent the method `MyMethod`. The method can be bound to the delegate because:  \n  \n-   The parameter type of the delegate (`Derived`) is more restrictive than the parameter type of `MyMethod` (`Base`), so that it is always safe to pass the argument of the delegate to `MyMethod`.  \n  \n-   The return type of `MyMethod` (`Derived`) is more restrictive than the parameter type of the delegate (`Base`), so that it is always safe to cast the return type of the method to the return type of the delegate.  \n  \n The code example produces no output.  \n  \n [!CODE [Delegate.CreateDelegate_RelaxedFit#1](../CodeSnippet/VS_Snippets_CLR/Delegate.CreateDelegate_RelaxedFit#1)]  \n  \n **Example 3**  \n  \n The following code example shows all the methods a single delegate type can represent, using the <xref:System.Delegate.CreateDelegate%2A> method to create the delegates.  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  There are two overloads of the <xref:System.Delegate.CreateDelegate%2A> method that specify  and a <xref:System.Reflection.MethodInfo>; their functionality is the same except that one allows you to specify whether to throw on failure to bind, and the other always throws. This code example uses both overloads.  \n  \n The code example defines two classes, `C` and `F`, and a delegate type `D` with one argument of type `C`. The classes have matching static and instance methods `M1`, `M3`, and `M4`, and class `C` also has an instance method `M2` that has no arguments.  \n  \n A third class named `Example` contains the code that creates the delegates.  \n  \n-   Delegates are created for instance method `M1` of type `C` and type `F`; each is closed over an instance of the respective type. Method `M1` of type `C` displays the `ID` properties of the bound instance and of the argument.  \n  \n-   A delegate is created for method `M2` of type `C`. This is an open instance delegate, in which the argument of the delegate represents the hidden first argument on the instance method. The method has no other arguments. It is called as if it were a static method.  \n  \n-   Delegates are created for static method `M3` of type `C` and type `F`; these are open static delegates.  \n  \n-   Finally, delegates are created for static method `M4` of type `C` and type `F`; each method has the declaring type as its first argument, and an instance of the type is supplied, so the delegates are closed over their first arguments. Method `M4` of type `C` displays the `ID` properties of the bound instance and of the argument.  \n  \n [!CODE [Delegate.CreateDelegateTOM_2#1](../CodeSnippet/VS_Snippets_CLR/Delegate.CreateDelegateTOM_2#1)]"

The first example demonstrates the four kinds of delegates that can be created: closed over an instance method, open over an instance method, open over a static method, and closed over a static method.  \n  \n The second code example demonstrates compatible parameter types and return types.  \n  \n The third code example defines a single delegate type, and shows all the methods that delegate type can represent.  \n  \n **Example 1**  \n  \n The following code example demonstrates the four ways a delegate can be created using this overload of the <xref:System.Delegate.CreateDelegate%2A> method.  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  There are two overloads of the <xref:System.Delegate.CreateDelegate%2A> method that specify  and a <xref:System.Reflection.MethodInfo>; their functionality is the same except that one allows you to specify whether to throw on failure to bind, and the other always throws. This code example uses both overloads.  \n  \n The example declares a class `C` with a static method `M2` and an instance method `M1`, and three delegate types: `D1` takes an instance of `C` and a string, `D2` takes a string, and `D3` has no arguments.  \n  \n A second class named `Example` contains the code that creates the delegates.  \n  \n-   A delegate of type `D2`, closed over an instance of `C`, is created for the instance method `M1`. It is invoked with different strings, to show that the bound instance of `C` is always used.  \n  \n-   A delegate of type `D1`, representing an open instance method, is created for the instance method `M1`. An instance must be passed when the delegate is invoked.  \n  \n-   A delegate of type `D2`, representing an open static method, is created for the static method `M2`.  \n  \n-   Finally, a delegate of type `D3`, closed over a string, is created for the static method `M2`. The method is invoked to show that it uses the bound string.  \n  \n [!CODE [Delegate.CreateDelegateTOM#1](../CodeSnippet/VS_Snippets_CLR/Delegate.CreateDelegateTOM#1)]  \n  \n **Example 2**  \n  \n The following code example demonstrates compatibility of parameter types and return types.  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  This code example uses the <xref:System.Delegate.CreateDelegate%28System.Type%2CSystem.Reflection.MethodInfo%29> method overload. The use of other overloads that take <xref:System.Reflection.MethodInfo> is similar.  \n  \n The code example defines a base class named `Base` and a class named `Derived` that derives from `Base`. The derived class has a `static` (`Shared` in Visual Basic) method named `MyMethod` with one parameter of type `Base` and a return type of `Derived`. The code example also defines a delegate named `Example` that has one parameter of type `Derived` and a return type of `Base`.  \n  \n The code example demonstrates that the delegate named `Example` can be used to represent the method `MyMethod`. The method can be bound to the delegate because:  \n  \n-   The parameter type of the delegate (`Derived`) is more restrictive than the parameter type of `MyMethod` (`Base`), so that it is always safe to pass the argument of the delegate to `MyMethod`.  \n  \n-   The return type of `MyMethod` (`Derived`) is more restrictive than the parameter type of the delegate (`Base`), so that it is always safe to cast the return type of the method to the return type of the delegate.  \n  \n The code example produces no output.  \n  \n [!CODE [Delegate.CreateDelegate_RelaxedFit#1](../CodeSnippet/VS_Snippets_CLR/Delegate.CreateDelegate_RelaxedFit#1)]  \n  \n **Example 3**  \n  \n The following code example shows all the methods a single delegate type can represent.  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  There are two overloads of the <xref:System.Delegate.CreateDelegate%2A> method that specify  and a <xref:System.Reflection.MethodInfo>; their functionality is the same except that one allows you to specify whether to throw on failure to bind, and the other always throws. This code example uses both overloads.  \n  \n The code example defines two classes, `C` and `F`, and a delegate type `D` with one argument of type `C`. The classes have matching static and instance methods `M1`, `M3`, and `M4`, and class `C` also has an instance method `M2` that has no arguments.  \n  \n A third class named `Example` contains the code that creates the delegates.  \n  \n-   Delegates are created for instance method `M1` of type `C` and type `F`; each is closed over an instance of the respective type. Method `M1` of type `C` displays the `ID` properties of the bound instance and of the argument.  \n  \n-   A delegate is created for method `M2` of type `C`. This is an open instance delegate, in which the argument of the delegate represents the hidden first argument on the instance method. The method has no other arguments.  \n  \n-   Delegates are created for static method `M3` of type `C` and type `F`; these are open static delegates.  \n  \n-   Finally, delegates are created for static method `M4` of type `C` and type `F`; each method has the declaring type as its first argument, and an instance of the type is supplied, so the delegates are closed over their first arguments. Method `M4` of type `C` displays the `ID` properties of the bound instance and of the argument.  \n  \n [!CODE [Delegate.CreateDelegateTOM_2#1](../CodeSnippet/VS_Snippets_CLR/Delegate.CreateDelegateTOM_2#1)]"

  summary: Determines whether the specified delegates are not equal.
  remarks: "Two delegates are considered not equal if they are of different types, or have different methods, different targets, or different invocation lists.  \n  \n If the two delegates are not of the same type, they are not considered equal.  \n  \n> [!IMPORTANT]\n>  In the .NET Framework version 1.0 and 1.1, two delegates are considered equal if their targets, methods, and invocation list were equal, even if the delegates were of different types.  \n  \n The methods and targets are compared for equality as follows:  \n  \n-   If the two methods being compared are both static and are the same method on the same class, the methods are considered equal and the targets are also considered equal.  \n  \n-   If the two methods being compared are instance methods and are the same method on the same object, the methods are considered equal and the targets are also considered equal.  \n  \n-   Otherwise, the methods are not considered to be equal and the targets are also not considered to be equal.  \n  \n Two invocation lists are not equal if they have different sizes, if they are ordered differently, or if at least one element from one list represents a method or target that is different from that represented by its corresponding element in the other list."
