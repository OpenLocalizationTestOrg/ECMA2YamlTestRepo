  summary: Contains constants for controlling the kind of access other <see cref="T:System.IO.FileStream"> objects can have to the same file.
  remarks: "For an example of creating a file and writing text to a file, see [How to: Write Text to a File](../Topic/How%20to:%20Write%20Text%20to%20a%20File.md). For an example of reading text from a file, see [How to: Read Text from a File](../Topic/How%20to:%20Read%20Text%20from%20a%20File.md). For an example of reading from and writing to a binary file, see [How to: Read and Write to a Newly Created Data File](../Topic/How%20to:%20Read%20and%20Write%20to%20a%20Newly%20Created%20Data%20File.md).  \n  \n A typical use of this enumeration is to define whether two processes can simultaneously read from the same file. For example, if a file is opened and F:System.IO.FileShare.Read?qualifyHint=False&autoUpgrade=True is specified, other users can open the file for reading but not for writing.  \n  \n A FileShare parameter is specified in some of the constructors for T:System.IO.FileStream?qualifyHint=False&autoUpgrade=True, T:System.IO.IsolatedStorage.IsolatedStorageFileStream?qualifyHint=False&autoUpgrade=True, and in some of the `Open` methods of T:System.IO.File?qualifyHint=False&autoUpgrade=True and T:System.IO.FileInfo?qualifyHint=False&autoUpgrade=True to control how a file is opened."
  example:
  - "The following T:System.IO.FileStream?qualifyHint=False&autoUpgrade=True constructor opens an existing file and grants read-only access to other users (F:System.IO.FileShare.Read?qualifyHint=False&autoUpgrade=True).  \n  \n [!CODE [Classic FileAccess Example#1](../CodeSnippet/VS_Snippets_CLR_Classic/classic FileAccess Example#1)]"
