## Remarks  
 This module supports the Visual Basic run-time library members that perform financial calculations such as depreciation, present and future values, interest rates, rates of return, and payments.  
  
   
  
## Examples  
 This example uses the `Rate` function to calculate the interest rate of a loan, given the total number of payments (`TotPmts`), the amount of the loan payment (`Payment`), the present value or principal of the loan (`PVal`), the future value of the loan (`FVal`), a number that indicates whether the payment is due at the beginning or end of the payment period (`PayType`), and an approximation of the expected interest rate (`Guess`).

## Remarks  
 The double-declining balance method computes depreciation at an accelerated rate. Depreciation is highest in the first period and decreases in successive periods.  
  
 The  and  arguments must be expressed in the same units. For example, if  is given in months,  must also be given in months. All arguments must be positive numbers.  
  
 The `DDB` function uses the following formula to calculate depreciation for a given period:  
  
 Depreciation / Period = ((Cost â€“ Salvage) * Factor) / Life  
  
   
  
## Examples  
 This example uses the `DDB` function to return the depreciation of an asset for a specified period given the initial cost (`InitCost`), the salvage value at the end of the asset's useful life (`SalvageVal`), the total life of the asset in years (`LifeTime`), and the period in years for which the depreciation is calculated (`Depr`).

## Remarks  
 An annuity is a series of fixed cash payments made over time. An annuity can be a loan (such as a home mortgage) or an investment (such as a monthly savings plan).  
  
 The  and  arguments must be calculated using payment periods expressed in the same units. For example, if  is calculated using months,  must also be calculated using months.  
  
 For all arguments, cash paid out (such as deposits to savings) is represented by negative numbers; cash received (such as dividend checks) is represented by positive numbers.  
  
   
  
## Examples  
 This example uses the `FV` function to return the future value of an investment given the percentage rate that accrues per period (`APR / 12`), the total number of payments (`TotPmts`), the payment (`Payment`), the current value of the investment (`PVal`), and a number that indicates whether the payment is made at the beginning or end of the payment period (`PayType`). Note that because `Payment` represents cash paid out, it is a negative number.

## Remarks  
 The internal rate of return is the interest rate received for an investment consisting of payments and receipts that occur at regular intervals.  
  
 The `IRR` function uses the order of values within the array to interpret the order of payments and receipts. Be sure to enter your payment and receipt values in the correct sequence. The cash flow for each period does not need to be fixed, as it is for an annuity.  
  
 `IRR` is calculated by iteration. Starting with the value of , `IRR` cycles through the calculation until the result is accurate to within 0.00001 percent. If `IRR` cannot find a result after 20 tries, it fails.  
  
   
  
## Examples  
 In this example, the `IRR` function returns the internal rate of return for a series of five cash flows contained in the array `Values()`. The first array element is a negative cash flow representing business start-up costs. The remaining four cash flows represent positive cash flows for the subsequent four years. `Guess` is the estimated internal rate of return.

## Remarks  
 The modified internal rate of return is the internal rate of return when payments and receipts are financed at different rates. The `MIRR` function takes into account both the cost of the investment () and the interest rate received on reinvestment of cash ().  
  
 The  and  are percentages expressed as decimal values. For example, 12 percent is expressed as 0.12.  
  
 The `MIRR` function uses the order of values within the array to interpret the order of payments and receipts. Be sure to enter your payment and receipt values in the correct sequence.  
  
   
  
## Examples  
 This example uses the `MIRR` function to return the modified internal rate of return for a series of cash flows contained in the array `Values()`. `LoanAPR` represents the financing interest, and `InvAPR` represents the interest rate received on reinvestment.

## Remarks  
 The net present value of an investment is the current value of a future series of payments and receipts.  
  
 The `NPV` function uses the order of values within the array to interpret the order of payments and receipts. Be sure to enter your payment and receipt values in the correct sequence.  
  
 The `NPV` investment begins one period before the date of the first cash flow value and ends with the last cash flow value in the array.  
  
 The net present value calculation is based on future cash flows. If your first cash flow occurs at the beginning of the first period, the first value must be added to the value returned by `NPV` and must not be included in the cash flow values of .  
  
 The `NPV` function is similar to the `PV` function (present value) except that the `PV` function allows cash flows to begin either at the end or the beginning of a period. Unlike the variable `NPV` cash flow values, `PV` cash flows must be fixed throughout the investment.  
  
   
  
## Examples  
 This example uses the `NPV` function to return the net present value for a series of cash flows contained in the array `values()`. The return value, stored in `FixedRetRate`, represents the fixed internal rate of return.

## Remarks  
 An annuity is a series of fixed cash payments made during a period of time. An annuity can be a loan (such as a home mortgage) or an investment (such as a monthly savings plan).  
  
 The  and  arguments must be calculated using payment periods expressed in the same units. For example, if  is calculated using months,  must also be calculated using months.  
  
 For all arguments, cash paid (such as deposits to savings) is represented by negative numbers; cash received (such as dividend checks) is represented by positive numbers.  
  
   
  
## Examples  
 This example uses the `Pmt` function to return the monthly payment for a loan during a fixed period. Given are the interest percentage rate per period (`APR / 12`), the total number of payments (`TotPmts`), the present value or principal of the loan (`PVal`), the future value of the loan (`FVal`), and a number that indicates whether the payment is due at the beginning or end of the payment period `(PayType).`

## Examples  
 In this example, the `PV` function returns the present value of an $1,000,000 annuity that will provide $50,000 a year for the next 20 years. Provided are the expected annual percentage rate (`APR`), the total number of payments (`TotPmts`), the amount of each payment (`YrIncome`), the total future value of the investment (`FVal`), and a number that indicates whether each payment is made at the beginning or end of the payment period (`PayType`). Note that `YrIncome` is a negative number because it represents cash paid out from the annuity each year.

## Remarks  
 An annuity is a series of fixed cash payments made over a period of time. An annuity can be a loan (such as a home mortgage) or an investment (such as a monthly savings plan).  
  
 For all arguments, cash paid out (such as deposits to savings) is represented by negative numbers; cash received (such as dividend checks) is represented by positive numbers.  
  
 `Rate` is calculated by iteration. Starting with the value of , `Rate` cycles through the calculation until the result is accurate to within 0.00001 percent. If `Rate` cannot find a result after 20 tries, it fails. If your guess is 10 percent and `Rate` fails, try a different value for .  
  
   
  
## Examples  
 This example uses the `Rate` function to calculate the interest rate of a loan given the total number of payments (`TotPmts`), the amount of the loan payment (`Payment`), the present value or principal of the loan (`PVal`), the future value of the loan (`FVal`), a number that indicates whether the payment is due at the beginning or end of the payment period (`PayType`), and an approximation of the expected interest rate (`Guess`).
