## Remarks  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  To view the .NET Framework source code for this type, see the [Reference Source](http://referencesource.microsoft.com/#mscorlib/system/io/path.cs#090eca8621a248ee). You can browse through the source code online, download the reference for offline viewing, and step through the sources (including patches and updates) during debugging; see [instructions](http://referencesource.microsoft.com/).  
  
 The .NET Framework does not support direct access to physical disks through paths that are device names, such as "\\\\.\PHYSICALDRIVE0 ".  
  
 A path is a string that provides the location of a file or directory. A path does not necessarily point to a location on disk; for example, a path might map to a location in memory or on a device. The exact format of a path is determined by the current platform. For example, on some systems, a path can start with a drive or volume letter, while this element is not present in other systems. On some systems, file paths can contain extensions, which indicate the type of information stored in the file. The format of a file name extension is platform-dependent; for example, some systems limit extensions to three characters, and others do not. The current platform also determines the set of characters used to separate the elements of a path, and the set of characters that cannot be used when specifying paths. Because of these differences, the fields of the `Path` class as well as the exact behavior of some members of the `Path` class are platform-dependent.  
  
 A path can contain absolute or relative location information. Absolute paths fully specify a location: the file or directory can be uniquely identified regardless of the current location. Relative paths specify a partial location: the current location is used as the starting point when locating a file specified with a relative path. To determine the current directory, call <xref:System.IO.Directory.GetCurrentDirectory%2A?displayProperty=fullName>.  
  
 Most members of the `Path` class do not interact with the file system and do not verify the existence of the file specified by a path string. `Path` class members that modify a path string, such as <xref:System.IO.Path.ChangeExtension%2A>, have no effect on names of files in the file system. `Path` members do, however, validate the contents of a specified path string, and throw an <xref:System.ArgumentException> exception if the string contains characters that are not valid in path strings, as defined in the characters returned from the <xref:System.IO.Path.GetInvalidPathChars%2A> method. For example, on Windows-based desktop platforms, invalid path characters might include quote ("), less than (\<), greater than (>), pipe (&#124;), backspace (\b), null (\0), and Unicode characters 16 through 18 and 20 through 25.  
  
 The members of the `Path` class enable you to quickly and easily perform common operations such as determining whether a file name extension is part of a path, and combining two strings into one path name.  
  
 All members of the `Path` class are static and can therefore be called without having an instance of a path.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  In members that accept a path as an input string, that path must be well-formed or an exception is raised. For example, if a path is fully qualified but begins with a space, the path is not trimmed in methods of the class. Therefore, the path is malformed and an exception is raised. Similarly, a path or a combination of paths cannot be fully qualified twice. For example, "c:\temp c:\windows" also raises an exception in most cases. Ensure that your paths are well-formed when using methods that accept a path string.  
  
 In members that accept a path, the path can refer to a file or just a directory. The specified path can also refer to a relative path or a Universal Naming Convention (UNC) path for a server and share name. For example, all the following are acceptable paths:  
  
-   "c:\\\MyDir\\\MyFile.txt" in C#, or "c:\MyDir\MyFile.txt" in Visual Basic.  
  
-   "c:\\\MyDir" in C#, or "c:\MyDir" in Visual Basic.  
  
-   "MyDir\\\MySubdir" in C#, or "MyDir\MySubDir" in Visual Basic.  
  
-   "\\\\\\\MyServer\\\MyShare" in C#, or "\\\MyServer\MyShare" in Visual Basic.  
  
 Because all these operations are performed on strings, it is impossible to verify that the results are valid in all scenarios. For example, the <xref:System.IO.Path.GetExtension%2A> method parses a string that you pass to it and returns the extension from that string. However, this does not mean that a file with that extension exists on the disk.

## Remarks  
 The character stored in this field cannot be in <xref:System.IO.Path.InvalidPathChars>. This field can be set to the same value as <xref:System.IO.Path.DirectorySeparatorChar>. `AltDirectorySeparatorChar` and `DirectorySeparatorChar` are both valid for separating directory levels in a path string.  
  
 The value of this field is a backslash ('\\') on UNIX, and a slash ('/') on Windows and Macintosh operating systems.

 The following code example demonstrates a use of the `AltDirectorySeparatorChar` field.

 The  parameter can contain multiple periods and any valid path characters, and can be any length. If  is `null`, the returned string contains the contents of  with the last period and all characters following it removed.

For example, if  is "\Dir1\examples\pathtests.csx.txt" and  is "cs", the modified path is "\Dir1\examples\pathtests.csx.cs".  
  
 It is not possible to verify that the returned results are valid in all scenarios. For example, if  is empty,  is appended.

## Remarks  
 In most cases, the string returned by this method consists of all characters in the path up to but not including the last <xref:System.IO.Path.DirectorySeparatorChar> or <xref:System.IO.Path.AltDirectorySeparatorChar>. If the path consists of a root directory, such as "c:\\", null is returned. Note that this method does not support paths using "file:". Because the returned path does not include the <xref:System.IO.Path.DirectorySeparatorChar> or <xref:System.IO.Path.AltDirectorySeparatorChar>, passing the returned path back into the GetDirectoryName method will result in the truncation of one folder level per subsequent call on the result string. For example, passing the path "C:\Directory\SubDirectory\test.txt" into the GetDirectoryName method will return "C:\Directory\SubDirectory". Passing that string, "C:\Directory\SubDirectory", into GetDirectoryName will result in "C:\Directory".

## Remarks  
 The extension of  is obtained by searching  for a period (.), starting with the last character in path and continuing toward the start of path. If a period is found before a <xref:System.IO.Path.DirectorySeparatorChar> or <xref:System.IO.Path.AltDirectorySeparatorChar> character, the returned string contains the period and the characters after it; otherwise, <xref:System.String.Empty> is returned.

## Remarks  
 The .NET Framework does not support direct access to physical disks through paths that are device names, such as "\\\\.\PHYSICALDRIVE0 ".  
  
 The absolute path includes all information required to locate a file or directory on a system.  
  
 The file or directory specified by  is not required to exist. For example, if c:\temp\newdir is the current directory, calling `GetFullPath` on a file name such as test.txt returns c:\temp\newdir\test.txt. The file need not exist.  
  
 However, if  does exist, the caller must have permission to obtain path information for . Note that unlike most members of the <xref:System.IO.Path> class, this method accesses the file system.  
  
 This method uses current directory and current volume information to fully qualify . If you specify a file name only in , `GetFullPath` returns the fully qualified path of the current directory.  
  
 If you pass in a short file name, it is expanded to a long file name.  
  
 If a path contains no significant characters it is invalid unless it contains one or more "." characters followed by any number of spaces, then it will be parsed as either "." or "..".
